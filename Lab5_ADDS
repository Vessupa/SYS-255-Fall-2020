There's nothing I can really put in detail that will explain my plan for next week, other than the fact that I will be going through every lab and updating my pages with the different commands needed to advance through the steps for next weeks assessment. In doing so, I plan on relearning the content while updating the notes just so some of that information is refreshed when we recreate our networks in that 24 hour period.
